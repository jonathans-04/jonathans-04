/*
6.	A bank charges a base fee of $10 per month, plus the following check fees for a commercial banking account:
$.10 each for less than 20 checks
$.08 each for 20-39 checks
$.06 each for 40-59 checks
$.04 each for 60 or more checks.
	
Create a Java application that asks for the number of checks written for the month. The application should then calculate and display the bankâ€™s services fees for the month.
